  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="Y"/>ES, Lowell, in a few words, describes
  the month of June, or, at least, he indicates something of it. But, still, what are perfect days?
  We look for them in April, when the birds, many of them, certainly the most attractive of them,
  return from the south, and we find ourselves, when we visit the woods and parks, disappointed that
  the sun does not shine, that the air is not soft and balmy, and that the grass and leaves and buds
  do not show themselves in spring attire, for, on the contrary, we find winter lingering
  distressingly near, that the merry Warblers are silent, and that the "greenery of young Nature" is
  very slow to indicate her presence or even her early coming. We pull our wrappings about us and go
  home. April past, we then fancy that her older sister, May, beautiful in literary
  imagery&mdash;for do we not recall descriptive visions of May days of long ago, when the human
  blossoms danced about the May pole, lolled luxuriantly in the soft, tender grass, hid themselves
  in the deep-leaved trees, and at last gratified our imaginations with the belief that she is
  altogether perfect? Unfortunately a chill takes possession of us and we return home disconsolate.
  May also has disappointed us. We have had an experience which we shall not forget. We have seen
  and recognized many birds, but they have not sung for us. They have been, as they almost always
  are, influenced by the elements. And why should they not be? They have but one suit of clothes.
  Have you observed the Robin in the early spring? He is worth watching. We watched a fine specimen
  in south Washington Park in March last. It was a comparatively mild day for the windy month. He
  perched on a lateral limb of a leafless tree a few yards from Sixtieth street. Whether he saw us
  or not we could not be sure, as he took little notice beyond saying <i>Toot-tut, toot-tut</i>! He
  ruffled his suit and seemed as fat as feathers could make him. They seemed as important to him as
  were buffalo robes to the sleighing parties of <span class="pagenum" id="page202">{202}</span>a
  few days before. Still he was observant and seemed to be looking for stray food that would warm
  him up. We had some fresh crackers in our pocket, which we broke into fine fragments, and
  scattered, withdrawing several yards away. To our surprise, not only the Robin but several
  Nuthatches, some Brown Creepers, a number of English Sparrows, three or four Bluejays, and a gray
  Squirrel, (from whence he came I could not conceive, there being no large tree near in which he
  might have had a winter home) came with great promptitude to feed on the unexpected offering.
  Others, no doubt, have had this experience. Does it not suggest that the birds which remain with
  us the whole year round&mdash;finding, of course, during the spring, summer, and fall, sufficient
  for their wants,&mdash;should be looked after a little bit, if only that they may be permitted to
  escape from the sometime unusually severe storms of winter? Nature has provided them with ample
  feathery protection from her ordinary moods, but when she breaks out in icy blasts and snow that
  covers the very face of her they suffer and they perish.</p>

  <p>But April, with its weather uncertainties&mdash;although it has long been said and believed
  that its showers bring May flowers&mdash;with its disappointments to all those who wish that the
  balm of mild breezes would come&mdash;longed for by the invalid and the convalescent, the lover of
  nature who would go forth to visit her and to court her, April seems a sort of humbug. And is May
  much better? How many days, "so calm, so sweet, so bright, the bridal of the earth and sky," come
  in May? A few do come, and we remember them. But, as Lowell says, perfect days are rare, even in
  June, when, if ever, come "perfect days." We think that Lowell nevertheless lived a little too far
  north to entitle him to state, even poetically, that perfect days are only to be enjoyed in June.
  Had he, with the writer, lived in southern Ohio, on the Little Miami river, and gone fishing in
  the month of May, he would, we think, have changed his mind. Or had he read the little less than
  perfect poem of W. H. Venable, which, it may be, however, was written later than the verses of
  our, many think, greatest poet, "June on the Miami," he might have put aside his books and his
  criticisms and his philosophy, and sought out the beautiful river of western history&mdash;then
  the sweetest stream that flowed in America, and even now, notwithstanding the giant sycamores have
  largely disappeared and the waters of the river have greatly diminished in volume, leaving only
  holes and ripples,&mdash;and modified his views of days perfect only in June. There were perfect
  days in May on the Miami. There were perfect days on all the streams that made it. The birds were
  multitudinous; they sang in chorus; they were, indeed, almost infinite in number&mdash;for the
  naturalist and the collector were unknown&mdash;the birds were <i>natural</i> residents, without
  fear of man, building their nests close to his habitations. A year or two ago we stopped off the
  cars in May in order to recall, if possible, in the shadow of a few remaining trees at a familiar
  place on the vanishing river, in the expected voices of the well known native birds, the
  delightful far-gone years. Verily we had our reward, but it was not satisfactory. It seems to us
  we should do our best, through legislation and personal influence to protect and multiply the
  birds.</p>

  dove.&mdash;The nest of the Carolina or Mourning Dove, which authorities place on the horizontal
  limb of a tree, is not always found in this situation, as I can testify. Last year, while
  wandering in early May through a piece of low woodland in Amherst, Mass., my eye was caught by a
  pair of well-grown youngsters covered with bluish pin feathers. The nest containing them&mdash;a
  loose affair of small sticks and leaves&mdash;was placed on the ground, or rather on the decayed
  base of a stump, surrounded by a ring of second-growth birches. Immediately suspecting their
  identity, I merged myself in the landscape after the manner of bird-lovers, and was soon rewarded
  by a sight of the parent Doves, who came sweeping down from a neighboring tree, uttering their
  pensive call-note. The pair had been frequent visitors about the lawn and drive-way for a few
  weeks previous.</p>

  <p>I have heard of another similar instance of ground-nesting on the part of Wild Doves.</p>

  <p class="ar">&mdash;<span class="sc">Dora Read Goodale.</span></p>

<hr style="width:6em"/>

  <p>Wrens&mdash;That clumsy little bunch of animated feathers, the Wren, is undoubtedly the most
  contented of dwellers on the face of the earth. In country or city he is never homeless. Anything
  hollow, with an aperture large enough to admit his jaunty little self is sufficient, and so long
  as it remains undisturbed he is a happy tenant. The variety of sites selected by this agile little
  creature, is greater than that of any other bird.</p>

  <p>It has been said that "a Wren will build in anything from a bootleg to a bomb-shell." And this
  seems to be so. Many an urchin can testify to having found the neat nest of the Wren in his
  cast-off shoe or a tin can, and nests filled with Wren eggs are frequent finds in odd places
  around the battle fields of the South.</p>

  <p>The home of a Wren, a few miles from Petersburg, Va., furnishes the strangest case in the
  matter of queer habitations yet discovered. This country is the site of one of the most dramatic
  epochs of the civil war, and frequently the bones of unburied soldiers are picked up. Recently a
  rusty old skull was found in which one of these Wrens chose a shelter. The skull, when found, was
  hidden in a patch of shrubbery. The interior of the one-time pate was carefully cleaned out, and
  nestled in the basin of the bony structure was the birth-place of many a baby Wren. The skull made
  a perfect domicile. A bullet hole in the rear formed a window. An eyeless socket was the exit and
  entrance to the grim home. It is easy to imagine that many a family feud had its origin in the
  desire of others to possess so secure a home.</p>

  <p>"I have myself," says A. W. Anthony, of San Diego, Cal., "watched Cactus Wrens in New Mexico
  carrying grass and thickening the walls of their old nests in October, for winter use, and have
  found them hidden in their nests during a snowstorm in November. But there is another trait in
  bird nature that I have seen very little of in print&mdash;that of building nests before or after
  the proper season, seemingly for the sole purpose of practice or pastime, the out-cropping of an
  instinct that prompts ambitious birds to build out of season even though they know that their work
  will be lost."</p>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p><span class="handonly">T</span><img src="images/initial_t.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="T"/>HIS species, which inhabits the
  coasts and islands of the north Atlantic and eastern Arctic ocean, and the Atlantic coast south to
  New Jersey, has the same general habits as the common Murre, which, like all the Auks, Murres and,
  Puffins, is eminently gregarious, especially in the breeding season. Davie says that tens of
  thousands of these birds congregate to make their nests on the rocky islands, laying single eggs
  near one another on the shelves of the cliffs. The birds sit side by side, and although crowded
  together never make the least attempt to quarrel. Clouds of birds may be seen circling in the air
  over some huge, rugged bastion, "forming a picture which would seem to belong to the imaginary
  rather than the realistic." They utter a syllable which sounds exactly like <i>murre</i>. The eggs
  are so numerous as to have commercial value, and they are noted for their great variation in
  markings and ground color. On the Farallones islands, where the eggs were until recently collected
  for market purposes, the Murres nest chiefly in colonies, the largest rookery covering a hillside
  and surrounding cliffs at West End, and being known as the Great Rookery. To observe the
  egg-gatherers, says an eye-witness, is most interesting. "As an egger climbs his familiar trail
  toward the birds a commotion becomes apparent among the Murres.  They jostle their neighbors about
  the uneven rocks and now and then with open bills utter a vain protest and crowd as far as
  possible from the intruder without deserting their eggs. But they do not stay his progress and
  soon a pair, then a group, and finally, as the fright spreads, the whole vast rookery take wing
  toward the ocean. In the distance, perhaps, we see, suspended over a cliff by a slender rope, an
  egger gathering the eggs from along the narrow shelves of rock, seeming indifferent to the danger
  of the work." All this is now changed, the authorities having intervened to prevent the wholesale
  destruction of the eggs. The Western Gull, however, is another enemy of the Murre (the California
  species;) it carries off and devours both eggs and young. Mr. Bryant says the Gull picks up a
  Murre's egg bodily and carries it away in his capacious mouth, but does not stick his bill into it
  to get hold, as is stated by some writers, whose observations must have referred to the eggs
  already broken by the Gulls or eggers.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The eggs of Brunnich's Murre cannot be distinguished from those of the common
  species. They show a wonderful diversity of color, varying from white to bluish or dark
  emerald-green. Occasionally unmarked specimens are found, but they are usually handsomely spotted,
  blotched, and lined in patterns of lilac, brown, and black over the surface.</p>

  us flying overhead, an old Gander in the lead, crying <i>honk, honk</i> as loud as he can. Our
  nests are only simple hollows in the sand, on the shores of lakes and rivers, around which are
  placed a few sticks and twigs, the five eggs laid on a layer of gray down.</p>

  <p>"You're a Goose."</p>

  <p>That's a polite way some people have of calling another stupid, but there are Geese and Geese
  as well as men and men. I am going to tell you about one Goose that dearly loved her master, and
  considering the way he treated her you may conclude she <i>was</i> a stupid Goose after all.</p>

  <p>Well, this particular Goose took such a fancy to her owner that she would follow him about like
  a dog, even to the village, where she would wait outside the barber's or other shop which he might
  enter.</p>

  <p>People noticed this, and instead of calling the farmer by his proper name began to speak of him
  as "Mr. Goosey." This angered the man and he ordered the poor loving Goose to be locked up in the
  poultry-yard. Shortly after he went to an adjoining town to attend a meeting; in the midst of the
  business he felt something warm and soft rubbing against his legs; he looked down and there stood
  his Goose, with protruding neck and quivering wings, gazing up at him with pleasure and fondness
  unutterable.</p>

  <p>The people about shouted with laughter, which so enraged her master, that seizing his whip, he
  twisted the thong of it about the poor bird's neck, swung her round and round, and supposing her
  dead, angrily threw her body out of the window.</p>

  <p>A few days after Mr. Goosey was seized with a severe illness, which brought him to the verge of
  the grave. He recovered, however, and was able at length to sit beside the open window. There on
  the grass sat the Goose gazing up at him with the same old look of affection in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Am I never to be rid of that stupid thing?" he cried, but when he was told that through all
  his illness the faithful bird had sat there opposite his window, scarcely touching food, his hard
  heart melted, and from thenceforth Mr. Goosey treated his feathered friend with the greatest
  kindness.</p>

  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="N"/>ORTH America at large is the range of
  this magnificent bird. Common Wild Goose and Grey Goose are its other names, and by which it is
  generally known. The Canada Goose is by far the most abundant and universally distributed of all
  North American Geese, and in one or other of its varieties is found in all the states and
  territories of our country except perhaps Florida and the Gulf States. In Texas, however, it is
  plentiful during the winter months. According to Hallock, although by far the greater portion of
  Wild Geese which pass the winter with us, go north to breed, still in suitable localities young
  are reared all over the United States from North Carolina to Canada. They nest in the wilder parts
  of Maine, and are especially numerous in Newfoundland near the secluded pools and streams so
  abundant throughout that island. There, remote from man, they breed undisturbed on the edges and
  islands of the ponds and lakes. The Geese moult soon after their arrival in the spring, and, says
  Hallock, owing to the loss of their pinion feathers are unable to fly during the summer or
  breeding seasons, but they can run faster than a man on the marshes, or if surprised at or near a
  pond, they will plunge in and remain under water with their bills only above the surface to permit
  breathing, until the enemy has passed by. They feed on berries and the seeds of grasses. Both the
  old and young become enabled to fly in September, and as soon after that as the frost affects the
  berries, and causes the seeds of the grasses on the marshes and savannas to fall to the earth, or
  otherwise when the snow falls and covers the ground, they collect in flocks and fly off to the
  southern shores of the island, and from thence to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where they remain
  until December, and then assembled, take flight in immense flocks to the southern parts of
  America, to return in the spring.</p>

  <p>The Canada Goose also breeds in great numbers on the Mississipi river, in which region it often
  places its nest in trees, choosing generally a cottonwood stub not more than thirty feet in
  height. The young are said to be carried from the nest to the water in the mother's bill, as are
  the young of the Wood Duck. (See <span class="sc">Birds</span>, vol. ii, p. 21).</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Wild Goose is often domesticated, and in many portions of the country they are
  bred in considerable numbers. When these birds return south at the commencement of winter they are
  generally very thin and poor, being quite worn out by their long journey. They soon recuperate,
  however, and in a short time become fat and are delicious eating. A full and excellent account of
  the method of capturing the Canada Goose may be found in Hallock's "Gazetteer."</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">THE BROWN CREEPER.</span></h2>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p>I'm not a showy looking bird like my friend the Woodpecker, but my habits are something like
  his&mdash;and so is my tail. He uses his, you know, to aid him in climbing trees, and so do I.
  They call me the <i>Creeper</i> because I am always creeping over the timber in search of insects.
  If you ever see a brown-streaked little fellow, resembling a Wren, traveling up a tree in short
  stages, now stopping to pick out an insect lurking in the crevices of the bark, or returning head
  downwards to pounce on an unwary fly, that is your humble servant the <i>Brown Creeper</i>. Up
  again, you will then see me creep, just like a little mouse, uttering now and then a low plaintive
  note; clear to the top I go, exploring every nook and cranny, never using my wings once.</p>

  <p>Last summer a little boy in the park wanted to get a good look at me, so he very slyly crept up
  to the tree which I was exploring, thinking, perhaps, that I was too busy to notice that he was
  there. But I did see him, for we little birds have to be always on the watch against our human, as
  well as feathered enemies, so I just stood still and peeked out at him from the other side of the
  tree. Very slily then he moved around to that side, and very slily did I move around to the other,
  keeping the tree trunk all the time between me and his bright blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"He's playing hide and seek with me, Mama," he shouted, and so pleased was the little fellow
  that it was quite a while before I flew away.</p>

  <p>Like the Woodpecker, I prefer a hole in a tree in which to build my nest, but instead of boring
  I look for a tree that has some of its bark loose enough for me to squeeze in. I line it with dry
  grass, moss, and feathers and see to it that the overhanging bark shelters me and my four, or six,
  white, red-speckled eggs.</p>

  <p><span class="handonly">A</span><img src="images/initial_a.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="A"/> LITTLE mite of a bird is this pretty
  creature, which many observers claim is seldom seen, or, indeed, is known to few besides the
  special student of ornithology and the collector. We venture to assert that any one with fairly
  good eyes can see it almost any day creeping over the timber in search of its insect food. Besides
  seeing it in the deepest woods, we often notice it in the open places in parks, and in gardens and
  orchards it is quite common. It commences operations at the foot of a tree, and travels upwards in
  short stages, "now stopping to pick out an insect lurking in the crevices of the bark with its
  long, slender bill, or returning head downwards to pounce on an unwary fly. Up again it creeps,
  more like a mouse than a bird, occasionally uttering a low and plaintive note; right to the top of
  the tree it mounts, exploring every nook and cranny likely to reward its search as it goes. Now it
  creeps on the under side of a projecting limb, then again on the top, and although it will explore
  an entire tree, still it but rarely uses its wings to convey it from one part to another. You will
  also find that it, like the Woodpecker, endeavors to be on the opposite side to you, and carry on
  its explorations unseen." Curiosity, however, often seems to get the better of the Creeper, and
  you will see its light colored breast and sharp little head peep trustfully at you and again
  vanish from sight.</p>

  <p>The Creeper is admirably adapted to its ways of life. Its bill is formed for obtaining its
  insect food, and its tail supports it while climbing.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Brown Creeper nests in early summer, when insect life is most abundant, and,
  like the Woodpecker, prefers a hole for the purpose. This it lines with dry grass, moss and
  feathers, and makes a very warm and comfortable home. The eggs are from five to eight, white,
  spotted and speckled with red. The Creeper is not migratory, and we see it in the woods throughout
  the year. It is hardy and lives sumptuously the winter through. One who was very fond of the
  little creatures said: "If the Swallow were to visit us at this time, it would undoubtedly perish,
  for the air in winter is almost clear of insect life; but the little Creeper can live in ease when
  the sun is at Capricorn, just because he can climb so dexterously, for the bark of trees abounds
  with insects, and more particularly their eggs and larvae, which lie there torpid until called
  into life by the genial presence of the vernal sun."</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">THE DOWNY WOODPECKER.</span></h2>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p>Another Woodpecker? Yes, there are such a tribe of us, you know; more than you can count on
  your fingers and toes, as my cousin the Red-Bellied Woodpecker said in the February number of
  <span class="sc">Birds</span>.</p>

  <p>The word toes reminds me that I am not one of the three-toed fellows he was so anxious to tell
  about. I have four, as you see, two before and two behind. So have most of the Woodpeckers. Should
  you be looking out for me this summer you will recognize me by my four toes, the white band down
  my back, and the two white stripes on the side of my head.</p>

  <p>My tongue you can't see, but it is small, flat, short, and horny, armed along the edges with
  hooks. When I catch an insect I do it by throwing my tongue forward, out of my mouth. I have an
  idea the insects consider my treatment of them rather rough. If I didn't eat them, the wood-boring
  ones, would destroy all the trees. My bill isn't strong enough to bore in the hard wood; I only
  injure the bark, no matter what some people may say. The wood-eating beetles, caterpillars,
  spiders, daddy longlegs, grass-hoppers, and flies, are all grist for my mill&mdash;or bill,
  rather. I like beechnuts, too, when I can find them.</p>

  <p>I'm the smallest of all the Woodpecker family, quiet and unobtrusive they say, in my manners. I
  am sociable, however, and go about a great deal in the company of other birds. Mr. Nuthatch, Mr.
  Brown Creeper, Mr. Titmouse, and Mr. and Mrs. Wren are my especial friends.</p>

  <p>Can I drum?</p>

  <p>Indeed, yes. I wouldn't belong to the Woodpecker family if I couldn't. All I need is the stub
  of a dead limb whose center is hollow and whose shell is hard and resonant. I will drum on that
  with my bill for an hour at a time, stopping now and then to listen for a response from my mate or
  a rival.</p>

  <p>Early in the spring we "Downies" pick a hole in a dead tree, or in a post or rail of a fence,
  in which we lay four, five, or six glossy white eggs. Sometimes it takes us a whole week to chisel
  out that hole, and we are so busy that a little boy or little girl can get very near without our
  minding it.</p>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <div class="poem poemc23 sp4">
    <p>Every leaf was at rest, and I heard not a sound,</p>
    <p>Save a Wood-drummer tapping on a hollow beech tree.</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="handonly">T</span><img src="images/initial_t.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="T"/>HIS little Woodpecker is the smallest
  of all those inhabiting the United States. In the shade trees about houses and parks, and
  especially in orchards, he may be frequently seen tapping or scratching on the limb of a tree
  within two or three yards' distance, where he has discovered a decayed spot inhabited by
  wood-boring larvae or a colony of ants, his food consisting of ants, beetles, bugs, flies,
  caterpillars, spiders, and grasshoppers. The late Dr. Glover of the Department of Agriculture,
  states that on one occasion a Downy Woodpecker was observed by him making a number of small,
  rough-edged perforations in the bark of a young ash tree, and upon examination of the tree when
  the bird had flown, it was found that wherever the bark had been injured, the young larvae of a
  wood-eating beetle had been snugly coiled underneath and had been destroyed by the bird. Beechnuts
  also constitute a considerable portion of the food of this bird. Dr. Merriam says that in northern
  New York they feed extensively on this nut, particularly in fall, winter, and early spring.</p>

  <p>This miniature Woodpecker is very social in its habits, far more so than other species, and is
  often found associated with other birds, in the woods, the orchards, along fence rows, and not
  infrequently in the cities. He is often seen in company with the White-breasted Nuthatch (See Vol.
  II, p. 118) and the Brown Creeper (Vol. III, p. <a href="#page214">214</a>).</p>

  <p>Early in the spring the "Downies" retire to the woods to make their nests, preferring the
  vicinity of running water. The nest is begun about the second or third week in May, and consumes
  from two days to a week in building. The holes are usually excavated in dead willow, poplar, or
  oak trees, and the height varies from four to thirty feet, generally about fifteen feet. The
  entrance to the nest is about two inches in diameter, and the depth of the nest hole varies from
  eight to eighteen inches. The eggs are four or five, rarely six, and are pure glossy-white.</p>

  <p>We know of no more interesting occupation than to observe this bird. It is fond of drumming on
  the stub of a dead limb whose center is hollow, and whose shell is hard and resonant. Upon such
  places it will drum for an hour at a time, now and then stopping to listen for a response from its
  mate or of some rival. At all times it is unsuspicious of man, and when engaged in excavating the
  receptacle for its nest it continues its busy chiseling, unheeding his near approach.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The Woodpecker is wrongfully accused of boring into the sound timber, and, by
  letting in the water, hastening its decay. As Dixon says: "Alas! poor harmless, unoffending
  Woodpecker, I fear that by thy visits to the trees thou art set down as the cause of their
  premature decay. Full well I know thy beak, strong as it is, is totally incapable of boring into
  the sound timber&mdash;full well do I know that, even if thou wert guilty of such offense, nothing
  would reward thy labors, for thy prey does not lurk under the bark of a healthy tree. Insects
  innumerable bore through its bark and hasten its doom, and it is thy duty in Nature's economy to
  check them in their disastrous progress."</p>

    <p>And now the little Wrens are fledged</p>
    <p style="margin-left:0.70em">And strong enough to fly;</p>
    <p>Wide their tiny wings they spread,</p>
    <p style="margin-left:0.70em">And bid the nest "good-bye."</p>
  </div>

  <p>Such a chattering as greeted Mrs. Wren when she returned with a fine black spider in her bill.
  All the children talked at once. Bobbie alone never uttered a word.</p>

  <p>"You naughty boy," exclaimed Mrs. Wren, turning to the crest-fallen Pierre, "did I not tell you
  to take care of your brothers and little sister? The idea of trying to fly before you have had a
  lesson! I have a good mind to whip every one of you," and the irate Mrs. Wren very unjustly did
  indeed peck every little head sharply with her bill.</p>

  <p>Bobbie cowered in the nest much too frightened to whimper or even mention the injury to one of
  his legs which he had sustained in his fall.</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Wren the next day proceeded to give the children a lesson or two in flying.</p>

  <p>"My tail is so stubby," wailed Emmett at the first trial, "it brings me right down to the
  ground."</p>

  <p>"Tho doth mine," lisped little Dorothy, "dess wish I had no tail at all, so I do," at which the
  others laughed very heartily.</p>

  <p>Bobbie made a heroic effort to do as did the rest, but at the first movement sank back into the
  nest with a cry of pain.</p>

  <p>"Such fortitude!" exclaimed Mrs. Wren when it was found one of his legs was broken, "not a
  whimper has the little fellow made since his fall. How heroic! How like my dear, dear papa!" and
  Mrs. Wren laughed, and then cried, from mingled pity and joy.</p>

  <p>"H'm," commented Mr. Wren, "if Bobbie had remembered the motto I gave them before I left
  yesterday morning, this accident wouldn't have happened. Can you repeat it?" turning to the eldest
  of the brood.</p>

  <p>"Be sure you're right, then go ahead," shouted Pierre, totally forgetting he had not heeded the
  rule any more than Bobbie.</p>

  <p>"Yes, a safe rule to go by," said Mr. Wren, gravely stroking his chin with one claw. "Dear,
  dear," ruefully examining the injured limb, "now the the child will go stumping through life like
  his grandpa. I only hope," with a dry cough, "that he'll not turn out a rowdy and lose one eye,
  too."</p>

  <p>"'He jests at scars who never felt a wound,'" loftily replied Mrs. Wren, who seemed never to
  forget a quotation. "For my part I am proud that one of my boys should turn out to be such a
  spirited little fellow. But there, Mr. Wren, the children are calling you from that bunch of weeds
  over yonder. Go down to them, while I fetch a nice canker-worm for Bobbie."</p>

  <p>After a few days the lame Bobbie was able to leave the nest and go hopping around with the
  other children, adding his feeble <i>chur chur</i> to theirs. Mr. and Mrs. Wren led them from one
  place to another, always among the weeds and shrubbery where they were soon taught to earn their
  own livelihood.</p>

  <p>"Moths, butterflies, gnats, flies, ants, beetles, and bugs constitute our bill of fare," said
  Mrs. Wren as they went whisking along, "together with thousand-legs, spiders, and worms. If we
  didn't eat them they would destroy the fruits in their seasons, so you see, my children, what
  valuable citizens we are in the world."</p>

  <p>At nightfall Mr. and Mrs. Wren, with their brood, flew to the crotch of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page221">{221}</span>a tree, and in ten seconds every little head was under a wing, and every
  little Wren sound asleep.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Wren one day, "the children are old enough now to take care of themselves, and
  we must begin, my dear, to build a nest in which once more to begin housekeeping."</p>

  <p>"It will not be in an old tin pot this time," replied Mrs. Wren, with a toss of her head, "and
  furthermore, Mr. Wren, I intend to have entirely new furniture."</p>

  <p>"Of course, of course," assented her mate, "whoever heard of a Wren raising a second brood in
  the same nest? We are much too neat and nice for that, my dear."</p>

  <p>"We," sniffed Mrs. Wren, ever ready for quarrel. "I'd like to know, Mr. Wren, what you had to
  do with building the nest, I would, really! Humph!" and Mrs. Wren flirted her tail over her head
  and laughed shrilly.</p>

  <p>"I brought the first sticks, my dear," he answered mildly, "and didn't I do all the house
  hunting? Besides, I forgot to tell you, that when looking about in April, I found two other
  apartments which, if the tin-pot had not appeared suitable, I intended to offer you. In order to
  secure them I partly furnished each, so that other house hunters would know they were not 'to
  let.'"</p>

  <p>"Humph!" returned Mrs. Wren, though exceedingly well pleased, "I'll wager we'll find a Sparrow
  family in each one of them."</p>

  <p>"No we won't," chuckled Mr. Wren "for the houses I selected were much too small for Mr. and
  Mrs. Sparrow to squeeze in."</p>

  <p class="sp3">"You clever fellow," exclaimed Mrs. Wren, pecking him gleefully with her bill. "I
  am proud of my hubby, I am, indeed," and Mr. Wren laughed, and hopped about, never hinting to his
  innocent spouse that all the gentlemen Wrens did the same thing every year.</p>

  <p>The next day, while preening their feathers, and getting ready for a visit to the apartments
  Mr. Wren had spoken of, a cry of distress smote upon their ears.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like our Dorothy's voice," said Mrs. Wren, her little knees knocking together in
  fright.</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> Dorothy calling for help," assented Mr. Wren. "I left the children in the
  orchard. Come, let us fly over there as quickly as we can."</p>

  <p>On the ground, under some bushes, they found huddled their frightened group of little ones,
  while above, on a limb of a tree, perched Mr. and Mrs. Jay, uttering at intervals their harsh cry
  of <i>jay, jay, jay</i>.</p>

  <p>"Its our Bobbie," cried Mrs. Wren, aghast, after she had counted her brood and found one of
  them missing, "look at him fighting over there with that young Jay."</p>

  <p>"That's it, give it to him," screamed the delighted Mr. Jay to his young son, "hit him in the
  eye, my boy, hit him in the eye."</p>

  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Wren flew about Bobbie uttering cries of distress.</p>

  <p>"Fair play, fair play," cried papa Jay, flying down almost upon Mr. Wren's back. "Give the
  young ones a chance, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A loud, sharp twitter from the tree top caused Mr. Jay to glance up.</p>

  <p>"My old enemy," he exclaimed, his crest falling at once, as a low crown encircling a pompon of
  orange-red showed itself among the green branches. "That tyrant, Mr. Kingbird. He's always
  meddling in other people's affairs, he is. I'd like to wring his neck. Come, Mrs. Jay; come, my
  son," he screamed, and off they flew to boast of the victory among their neighbors.</p>

  <p>"I hope your little boy is not much hurt," said Mr. Kingbird rather pompously, "I arrived just
  in the nick of time, I think."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page222">{222}</span></div>

  <p>"Oh, my Bobby," wailed Mrs. Wren, wiping the blood from his face, "that dreadful Jay has
  scratched out one of his eyes."</p>

  <p>"How did it happen?" sternly inquired Mr. Wren, "tell me the truth or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Dorothy interrupted her father with loud sobbing.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I was flirting," she stammered "just a <i>little</i>, with young Mr. Jay,
  papa&mdash;you know how handsome he is, and bold&mdash;when Bobby steps up, and he says&mdash;he
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, go on, my little miss," said Mr. Kingbird, deeply interested, "what did your brother
  say?"</p>

  <p>"He said," wiping her eyes with a corner of her wing, "that 'birds of a feather flock
  together,' and a girl with such a grandpa as I had should be ashamed to associate with the son of
  a robber and coward like Mr. Bluejay, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And so young Mr. Jay pitched into me," interrupted Bobbie, "and I pitched into him. I'd a
  licked him, too, Pop," he added, flourishing his crippled leg, "if his old pa and ma hadn't come
  up when they did and told him to hit me in the eye."</p>

  <p>"A chip off the old block, ma'am," said Mr. Kingbird, who had heard of Mrs. Wren's fighting
  papa, "a chip off the old block, I see. Well, good-day all, good-day. As your son wisely says
  'birds of a feather flock together,' and it wouldn't look well, you know, for a person of my
  aristocratic appearance to be seen in such humble company. So good-day, good-day," and off the
  pompous fellow flew leaving Mr. and Mrs Wren decidedly angry though grateful.</p>

  <p>Another week found the pair building a nest in the cavity of a maple tree near the study
  window. To the sticks and straws which Mr. Wren had placed therein early in the season, Mrs. Wren
  added spider webs and cocoons, lining the nest, or furnishing it as she called it, with horsehair
  and the downiest goose and duck feathers she could procure.</p>

  <p>"There!" said she, when all was completed and the first egg laid, "Mrs. John can't sneer at our
  home now. No coarse chicken feathers, or stable straw this time, Mr. Wren. We will use the other
  apartment you chose for the third brood, for three we are to have this summer as well as Mrs.
  John. When we go south in November, our family I intend shall be as large as hers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wren made no answer, but, possibly being such an uncommonly wise bird, inwardly marveled
  over that imperious force, that wonderful instinct which made it necessary for them and all the
  feathered tribe to reproduce their kind.</p>

  <p>Very carefully, one winter's day, Bridget removed the nest from the tin-pot and wreathing it in
  ribbons, hung it above her chest of drawers in the the attic.</p>

  <p>"It do same," said she to the children, who prided themselves upon their knowledge of the looks
  and habits of the House Wren, "that in sthudoin the birds this summer I do be afther learnin' a
  lesson I wasn't expectin' meself at all."</p>

  <p>"A lesson?" said they curiously.</p>

  <p>"Indade! Its young ye's aire, me darlint's, to be thinkin' of the same, but sure its not meself
  that'll ever be forgetten the patience, ingenuity, industhry, and conjoogal love of the wee pair.
  Faith but it was a purty sight. Dumb animals indade! Niver sphake to me of <i>dumb</i> animals,
  for be St. Patrick, if them two blessed little crathers didn't talk, schold, make love, and sing
  in a langwidge all their own, then me grandfather's name wasn't Dinnis, and I'm not Bridget
  O'Flaherty, at all, at all."</p>

  <p><span class="handonly">H</span><img src="images/initial_h.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="H"/>ERE is an instance where the female
  is the head of the family indeed, for by common consent the name includes the male of this
  species. It has numerous other names, however, as Old Wife, South-Southerly, Long-tailed Duck,
  Swallow-tailed Duck, Old Injun (Massachusetts and Connecticut;) Old Molly, Old Billy, Scolder,
  (New Hampshire and Massachusetts.)</p>

  <p>The habitat of the Old Squaw is the northern hemisphere; in America, south in winter to nearly
  the southern border of the United States. It is distributed throughout the northern portions of
  the globe, but makes its summer home in Arctic regions. George Harlow Clarke, Naturalist, Peary
  Polar Expedition, in a recent article mentioned that, "in June the Old Squaw's clanging call
  resounded everywhere along shore, and the birds themselves were often perceived gliding to and fro
  amid the ice cakes drifting with the tide between the main ice-floe and the land." It is a
  resident in Greenland and breeds in various places in Iceland. The nests are made on the margins
  of lakes or ponds, among low bushes or tall grass, are constructed of grasses, and generally, but
  not always, warmly lined with down and feathers. The eggs are from six to twelve in number. In the
  United States the Long-tail is found only in winter. Mr. Nelson found it to be an abundant winter
  resident on Lake Michigan, where the first stragglers arrived about the last of October, the main
  body arriving about a month later and departing about the the first of April, a few lingering
  until about the last of the month.</p>

  <p>The words <i>south&mdash;south&mdash;southerly</i>, which some have fancied to resemble its
  cry, and which have accordingly been used as one of its local names, did not, to the ear of Dr.
  Brewer, in the least resemble the sounds which the bird makes; but he adds that the names "Old
  Wives" and "Old Squaws" as applied to the species are not inappropriate, since when many are
  assembled their notes resemble a confused gabble. Hallock says that most of the common names of
  this Duck are taken from its noisy habits, for it is almost continually calling.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Mr. E. P. Jaques, asks, in <i>Field and Stream</i>, "What has become of our
  Waterfowl?" assuming that their numbers have greatly diminished. "The answer is a simple one," he
  goes on to say; "they have followed conditions. Take away their breeding and feeding grounds and
  the birds follow. Bring back their breeding and feeding grounds and lo! the birds reappear. For
  the past five years waterfowl have been about as scarce in the Dakotas as in Illinois or Indiana.
  The lakes were dry and conditions were unfavorable for them. In the spring of 1897 the lakes
  filled up once more. For the most part the bottoms of the lakes were wheat stubbles. This
  furnished food for the spring flight and thousands of birds nested there. When the wheat was gone
  the aquatic growth took its place and for every thousand Ducks that tarried there in the spring,
  ten thousand appeared in the fall."</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">THE WHITE-FACED GLOSSY
  IBIS.</span></h2>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p>Ibises, of which there are about thirty species, are distributed throughout the warmer parts of
  the globe. Four species occur in North America. According to Chapman, they are silent birds, and
  live in flocks during the entire year. They feed along the shores of lakes, bays, and salt-water
  lagoons, and on mud flats over which the tide rises and falls.</p>

  <p>The beautiful, lustrous White-faced Glossy Ibis inhabits the south-western United States and
  tropical America. It is found as far north as Kansas, and west through New Mexico and Arizona to
  California. In southern Texas it is very abundant, and in some localities along the banks of the
  Rio Grande swarms by thousands. Dr. J. C. Merrill in May, visited a large patch of tule reeds,
  growing in a shallow lagoon about ten miles from Fort Brown, in which large numbers of this Ibis
  and several kinds of Herons were breeding. The reeds grew about six feet above the surface of the
  water, and were either beaten down to form a support for the nests, or dead and partly floating
  stalks of the previous year were used for that purpose. Dr. Merrill states that it was impossible
  to estimate the number of Ibises and different Herons nesting here. "Both nests and eggs of the
  Ibises were quite unlike those of any of the Herons, and could be distinguished at a glance. The
  nests were made of broken bits of dead tules, supported by and attached to broken and upright
  stalks of living ones. They were rather well and compactly built, quite unlike the clumsy
  platforms of the Herons. The eggs were nearly always three in number, and at this date were far
  advanced toward hatching; many of the nests contained young of all sizes."</p>

  <p>The walk of the Ibis is quiet and deliberate, though it can move over the ground with
  considerable speed whenever it chooses. Its flight is lofty and strong, and the bird has a habit
  of uttering a loud and peculiar cry as it passes through the air.</p>

  <p>The Ibis was formerly invested with sacerdotal honors by the ancient Egyptians, and embalmed
  and honored after death with a consecrated tomb, in common with the bull and the cat. The bird
  probably owes its sacred character to the fact that its appearance denotes the rising of the Nile,
  an annual phenomenon on which depends the prosperity of the whole country.</p>

  <p>The food of the Ibis consists mostly of mollusks, both terrestrial and aquatic, but it will eat
  worms, insects, and probably the smaller reptiles.</p>

  <p>The sexes have similar plumage, but the female is smaller than her mate.</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">THE ARKANSAS
  KINGBIRD.</span></h2>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p><span class="handonly">O</span><img src="images/initial_o.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="O"/>NE of the difficulties of the
  scientific ornithologist is to differentiate species. This bird is often confounded with the
  Flycatchers, and for a very good reason, its habits being similar to those of that family. It is
  almost a counterpart of the Kingbird, (See <span class="sc">Birds</span>, vol. ii, p. 157)
  possessing a harsher voice, a stronger flight, and, if possible, a more combative, pugnacious
  spirit. It is a summer resident, is common in the western United States, and occasionally a
  straggler far eastward, migrating southward in winter to Guatemala.</p>

  <p>Col. Goss, in his history of the birds of Kansas, one of the most comprehensive and valuable
  books ever published on ornithology, says that the nesting places and eggs of this species are
  essentially the same as those of the Kingbird. They are brave and audacious in their attacks upon
  the birds of prey and others intruding upon their nesting grounds. Their combative spirit,
  however, does not continue beyond the breeding season. They arrive about the first of May, begin
  laying about the middle of that month, and return south in September. The female is smaller than
  the male and her plumage is much plainer.</p>

  <p>Mr. Keyser "In Birdland" tells an interesting story which illustrates one of the well known
  characteristics of the Kingbird. "One day in spring," he says, "I was witness to a curious
  incident. A Red-headed Woodpecker had been flying several times in and out of a hole in a tree
  where he (or she) had a nest. At length, when he remained within the cavity for some minutes, I
  stepped to the tree and rapped on the trunk with my cane. The bird bolted like a small cannon ball
  from the orifice, wheeled around the tree with a swiftness that the eye could scarcely follow, and
  then dashed up the lane to an orchard a short distance away. But he had only leaped out of the
  frying-pan into the fire. In the orchard he had unconsciously got too near a Kingbird's nest. The
  Kingbird swooped toward him and alighted on his back. The next moment the two birds, the Kingbird
  on the Woodpecker's back, went racing across the meadow like a streak of zigzag lightning, making
  a clatter that frightened every echo from its hiding place. That gamy Flycatcher actually clung to
  the Woodpecker's back until he reached the other end of the meadow. I cannot be sure, but he
  seemed to be holding to the Woodpecker's dorsal feathers with his bill. Then, bantam fellow that
  he was, he dashed back to the orchard with a loud chippering of exultation. 'Ah, ha!' he flung
  across to the blushing Woodpecker, 'stay away the next time, if you don't fancy being converted
  into a beast of burden?'"</p>

  <p>Eggs three to six, usually four, white to creamy white, thinly spotted with purple to dark
  reddish brown, varying greatly in size.</p>

  <p><span class="handonly">A</span><img src="images/initial_a.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="A"/>N English terrier, despoiled of her
  litter of puppies, wandered around quite inconsolable. A brood of ducklings one day attracted her
  attention. Notwithstanding their quacks of protest, she seized them in her mouth, bore them to her
  kennel, and with the most affectionate anxiety followed them about, giving them, in her own
  fashion, a mother's care.</p>

  <p>When the ducklings at length took to water, her alarm knew no bounds. "You dreadful children,"
  her sharp barks seemed to say when they returned to land, and taking them in her mouth bore them
  one by one back to safety, as she thought, to the kennel.</p>

  <p>The year following, when again deprived of her puppies, she adopted two cock-chickens, rearing
  them with the same care she had bestowed upon the ducklings. Their voices, however, when they grew
  older, greatly annoyed her, and by various means their foster-mother endeavored to stifle their
  crowing.</p>

<hr style="width:4em"/>

  <p>A hen that had selected an unused manger in which to lay her eggs, and rear her brood, found
  that the barn cat had also selected the same place in which to pass her hours of repose. The hen
  made no objection to the presence of Mrs. Tabby, and <i>vice-verse</i>, so that a strong frendship
  in time grew up between the two.</p>

  <p>Things went on very smoothly, the hen placidly sitting on her eggs, while Mrs. Tabby came and
  went at will, spending at least half her time beside her companion as friendly as though she were
  a sister cat.</p>

  <p>Vainly did the hen sit, vainly did she turn her eggs. All the warmth in the world would not
  have hatched a chick from the stale eggs beneath her.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Tabby, however, had better luck. To the hen's amazement she found beneath her very nose
  one morning five squirming furry little creatures which might have been chicks but were not.
  Certainly they were young of some sort, she reflected, and with true motherly instinct she lent
  her aid to their proper bringing up.</p>

  <p>The kittens thrived, but unfortunately, when still of tender age were deprived, by death of
  their mother. All but one of her offspring found comfortable homes elsewhere, and that one
  received the devoted attention of the hen during the whole of that summer.</p>

  <p class="sp3">"To see it going between the house and barn clucking for the kitten," says Dr.
  Beadner in <i>Our Animal Friends</i>, "was indeed a funny sight, and quite as remarkable to see
  the kitten run to her when she made the peculiar call that chickens understand means something to
  eat. At night and during the resting hours of the daytime, kittie would crawl under the warm wings
  of her foster mother; and the brooding hen and her nestling kitten were happy and contented,
  little dreaming and caring less that they were so far from being related to each other."</p>

  <h2 class="ac" style="margin-bottom:1.3ex;"><span class="larger">ONE AUDUBON SOCIETY.</span></h2>

  <p><span class="handonly">F</span><img src="images/initial_f.png" class="nothand"
  style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="F"/>IVE hundred invitations were sent out
  for a novel reception by the Wisconsin Audubon Society a while ago. One of the directors lent a
  large, handsome house, and six milliners were invited to send hats unadorned with aigrettes or
  birds. Ostrich plumes, quills and cock's-tails were not disbarred. Twenty-five other milliners
  applied for space, "everybody" went, and a great many tastefully trimmed hats were sold. People
  who had never before heard of the Audubon Society became, through the newspaper reports of the
  affair, greatly interested in its object, and the society itself greatly encouraged through the
  fact that by their hats and bonnets many of the "best" people of Milwaukee were ready to proclaim
  it no longer good form to wear the plumes or bodies of wild birds.</p>

  <p>"Certificates of heartlessness," a writer in <i>Our Dumb Animals</i> calls them and we know of
  no better appellation to apply. Women of fashion, says the same writer, have been urged to use the
  power which they possess&mdash;and it is a power greater than that of law&mdash;to bring this
  inhumanity to an instant stop. The appeals for the most part were in vain. Birds continue to be
  slaughtered by millions upon millions, simply for the gratification of a silly vanity of which
  intelligent women should be ashamed. Whole species of the most beautiful denizens of field and
  forest, woodland and shore, have been almost or quite exterminated. Song birds have been driven
  further and further from the dwellings of men; our country is stripped of one of its least costly
  and most charming delights and all that women may deck themselves in conformity with a fad.</p>

  <p>A bill for the protection of birds was passed on March 24, by the Senate of the United States,
  introduced into the House of Representatives on March 25, and referred to the Committee on
  Agriculture. It is entitled "An Act for the Protection of Song Birds."</p>

  <p>We confess, says the same writer, to a feeling of humiliation when reading this bill, because
  it seems a just indictment of the women of America on a charge of willful, wanton, reckless
  inhumanity. That such legislation should be made necessary, through vanity alone, ought in our
  estimation, to bring the blush of shame to every good woman's cheek.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think," is the usual reply of the fair sex, when approached on the subject. "I didn't
  think." Aye you didn't think, but that plea can no longer avail when press and pulpit, in the name
  of humanity, so earnestly and eloquently plead with you to spare the birds.</p>

  <p>If compassion for the little creature whose life went out in agony, to supply that ornament
  above your brow does not move you to abstain from wearing such in the future, then the knowledge
  that some of the "best" people in the country consider it "bad form," perhaps will.</p>

    <p>Letting the deer pass free; would oft-times yield</p>
    <p>His half-won race because the laboring steeds</p>
    <p>Fetched painful breath; or if his princely mates</p>
    <p>Saddened to lose, or if some wistful dream</p>
    <p>Swept o'er his thoughts. And ever with the years</p>
    <p>Waxed this compassionateness of our Lord,</p>
    <p>Even as a great tree grows from two soft leaves</p>
    <p>To spread its shades afar; but hardly yet</p>
    <p>Knew the young child of sorrow, pain, or tears,</p>
    <p>Save as strange names for things not felt by kings,</p>
    <p>Nor ever to be felt. But it befell</p>
    <p>In the royal garden on a day of spring,</p>
    <p>A flock of wild Swans passed, voyaging north</p>
    <p>To their nest-places on Himâla's breast.</p>
    <p>Calling in love-notes down their snowy line</p>
    <p>The bright birds flew, by fond love piloted;</p>
    <p>And Devadatta, cousin of the prince,</p>
    <p>Pointed his bow, and loosed a willful shaft</p>
    <p>Which found the wide wing of the foremost Swan</p>
    <p>Broad-spread to glide upon the free blue road,</p>
    <p>So that it fell, the bitter arrow fixed,</p>
    <p>Bright scarlet blood-gouts staining the pure plumes.</p>
    <p>Which seeing, Prince Siddârtha took the bird</p>
    <p>Tenderly up, rested it in his lap&mdash;</p>
    <p>Sitting with knees crossed, as Lord Buddha sits&mdash;</p>
    <p>And, soothing with a touch the wild thing's fright,</p>
    <p>Composed its ruffled vans, calmed its quick heart,</p>
    <p>Caressed it into peace with light kind palms</p>
    <p>As soft as plantain leaves an hour unrolled;</p>
    <p>And while the left hand held, the right hand drew</p>
    <p>The cruel steel forth from the wound, and laid</p>
    <p>Cool leaves and healing honey on the smart.</p>
